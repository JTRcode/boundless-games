README External tools used:

For the most part, everything for our app is internally created. The only external tool that we use in our project is an open source JSON-serialization and deserialization tool.

README Game Instructions & Features

THE GAMES:

1) GPA Catcher

Try to gain a high GPA in a limited time as much as you can!
Move the character to the right or left in order to catch the assignments, which increase your GPA, the clock, which gives you extra time and ‘sleep’ which provides you an extra life.
The player has three lives initially.
Each time the player misses an assignment or hit by a bomb, s/he loses one life.
Each time the player catches a clock, s/he will get additional time.
Each time the player catches a sleep. s/he will get additional life.
The game ends if the player loses three lives or the game runs out of time.

2) Pixel Game

Fill in the pixels and figure out what the picture is!
The pixel game has six levels with different difficulties.
The labels indicate the number and length of the pixels in each row or column.
For example, ‘11’ means that there is only one pixel grouping of length 11  in this row or column (11 filled-in pixels in a row), while ‘3 3 1’ means that there are three filled-in pixels in a row and then another three filled-in pixels in a row which are not next to each other (otherwise it will be one 6) and another grouping of length 1 in this row or column.
The grid is initially empty.
For the first time that the player touches the grid, it fills in the color. On a second touch, the pixel turns into a state indicating you have decided this is NOT filled in for the final image, then a third touch brings it back to empty again.
The stage will automatically end when you get the correct answer.

3) Rotate Tile

Rotate the tiles and let the water go through!
The player needs to rotate the tiles and make a path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
The stage will automatically end when you get the correct answer.

APP FEATURES:

1) Customizations

The customization page provides players different choices of background, background music, and another special theme.
The background and background music only show up on the game page.
The backgrounds of other pages are not changed. Notice that it can only be changed when the special theme option is off.
If the theme is on, then the backgrounds of all pages are changed to a specific theme (for example, the Christmas theme) and the background music is also fixed.

2) Stats

The game tracks three statistics and they are only recorded while in-game (i.e. not on the menu, customizations, shop, etc). The game tracks: total time (in seconds), your points (a randomly generated amount when you successfully complete a game/stage), and the number of times you press/tap the screen.
The statistics can be viewed on the statistics page, accessible through the main menu.
The points earned here can be redeemed in the shop for various in-game unlockables and prizes.

3) Achievements

The game also features in-game achievements that are accessible through the statistics page.
Each game has its own set of achievements that are unlocked by meeting various requirements such as completing a stage in a certain amount of time or getting a certain final GPA.
Clicking on the medal images will display a message on the screen with the achievement requirement.
Once fulfilled, a checkmark will be displayed below the achievement to mark its completion.

4) Sign in

The sign in saves the user's credentials between the user closing/opening the app so that you will stay signed in until you decide to sign back out by clicking the 'Sign out' button.

5) Shop

The shop contains "consumable items" that the user can purchase using in-game points, obtained from playing any of the three games.
Each item is game specific, some are used immediately while others must be used in-game from the bottom of the pause menu.
Although multiples of the same item can be purchased, only one of them can be used at a time.
Clicking on either the image or description of any item will automatically add the item to the shop inventory, which can contain a maximum of 20 items at any given time.
